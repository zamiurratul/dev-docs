Version Control window has been redesigned, you can find "Local Changes" under "Commit" tab on left side of the window next to the Project tab.

You can see what's new here: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/whatsnew/#version-control

If you want to restore old view then you need to disable "use non-modal commit interface" under Preferences | Version Control | Commit




==============
Adjust number of open tabs
In the Settings/Preferences dialog ( Ctrl+Alt+S ) , go to Editor | General | Editor Tabs
